      <div class="t-info1">Education in today's world is the one quality which will define a nation.
         It is the amalgamation of multifarious qualities which together constitute education.
         In this process school is the first stepping stone to learning. It is here that a child
         imbibes all the values combined with a sound knowledge which equip her/him with all the
         pre-requisites to accept all the challenges of life with confidence and a smile. A good
         education ensures that a child is able to hold her/his self esteem high and rub shoulders
         with the best of people. It is with this aim that we laid the foundation stone of Maxfort 
         School, Dwarka. It has been nurtured as a place that will bring the best practices in the 
         field of education to the community living here. It is being developed as the institution
         which brings out the best in all its students so that they truly put this sub-city on the
         world map of movers and shakers. To this I stand committed and will ensure that the
         committed faculty that we have brought here not just empowers students but also turns
         them into thinking individuals.Looking forward to your encouragement and partnership in
         this shared journey of learning.
